Gridfill
---

Gridfill is a classic game about filling up a screen, one colored block/group at a time, until the screen is all one color. There are many variations on this style of game.

Gridfill incorporates a stack-based filling algorithm to flood and find boundaries when a color is clicked. Should you click on a red cell, the top-left group will change to red, filling all areas it matches with the color red. As the group grows larger, so does the amount of space you cover with each color swap. Click on colors until you fill the entire screen.
