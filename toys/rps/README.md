Rock Paper Scissors
---

Rock Paper Scissors is a micro-simulator about rocks, papers and scissors hunting eachother down for all eternity (maybe). Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. If one touches another and "beats" it, it converts it into the thing it was beaten by. Watch as waves of scissors run at hordes of papers before being thwarted by waves of rocks.

A random number generator determines the positions of all pieces, and pieces will run at each other or away from each other depending on the combinations. Runs until only one group is victorious and standing.
